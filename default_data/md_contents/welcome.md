# Welcome to snippets !

This web app allows you to store and share
your code snippets, boilerplates, handy scripts
and tutorials and access them from anywhere.

To get started, you can click on the "New Snippet" button
to create your first snippet, give it a title,
a markdown description and one or more code files.

For a better organization, you can add tags
to the snippets you created.

You can also keep your snippets completely private
or chose to share them with the world.

Finally, the search feature allows you to browse
your snippets more easily once your collection grows.
